## 👋 Hello there

Welcome to my (modest) GitHub page!

I'm Florian, a **senior gameplay programmer** currently working at **Sandfall Interactive** (Montpellier, France). I previously worked at **Ubisoft** (Montpellier and Singapore) for 6 years.

I mainly code in **C++**, but I am trying new stuff and always learning. 
You will find here the different projects I am working and worked on.
One of my lastest project is a fan game of Pokémon, [try it out here](https://torresflo.github.io/Pokemon-Obsidian/)!

Pokémon Gold

📅 Released November 21, 1999
🏗️ Created by Game Freak
🕹️ Playable on Game Boy Color, Nintendo 3DS (Virtual Console)

Pokémon Gold expanded the Pokémon universe with new creatures, mechanics, and
the introduction of a real-time day and night system. Players explore the Johto
region while collecting Pokémon, battling Gym Leaders, and thwarting Team
Rocket’s plans. The game is celebrated for its sense of discovery, depth, and
the surprise return to the Kanto region after completing the main story.
