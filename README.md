## 👋 Hello there

Welcome to my (modest) GitHub page!

I'm Florian, a **gameplay programmer** currently working at **Ubisoft Montpellier**. I mainly code in **C++**, but I am trying new stuff and always learning. 
You will find here the different projects I am working and worked on. One of my lastest project is a fan game of Pokémon, try it out [here](https://torresflo.github.io/Pokemon-Obsidian/)!
