## 👋 Hello there

Welcome to my (modest) GitHub page!

I'm Florian, a **senior gameplay programmer** currently working at **Sandfall Interactive** (Montpellier, France). I previously worked at **Ubisoft** (Montpellier and Singapore) for 6 years.

I mainly code in **C++**, but I am trying new stuff and always learning. 
You will find here the different projects I am working and worked on.
One of my lastest project is a fan game of Pokémon, [try it out here](https://torresflo.github.io/Pokemon-Obsidian/)!
