## 👋 Hello there

Welcome to my (modest) GitHub page!

I'm Florian, a **senior gameplay programmer** currently working at **Sandfall Interactive** (Montpellier, France). I previously worked at **Ubisoft** (Montpellier and Singapore) for 6 years.

I mainly code in **C++**, but I am trying new stuff and always learning. 
You will find here the different projects I am working and worked on.
One of my lastest project is a fan game of Pokémon, [try it out here](https://torresflo.github.io/Pokemon-Obsidian/)!

Fable

📅 Released September 14, 2004
🏗️ Created by Lionhead Studios
🕹️ Playable on Xbox, PC, Xbox 360

Fable is an action role-playing game set in the fantasy world of Albion, where
player choices directly shape the hero’s appearance and morality. The game
emphasizes freedom, allowing players to decide how their character behaves and
is perceived by others. Its blend of humor, storytelling, and consequence-driven
gameplay made it a memorable RPG experience.
